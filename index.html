		<p>Ghaul: Tell me again, Speaker: What makes your Guardians worthy of the Light? What is the price of such power and immortality?<br>
			The Speaker: Devotion. Self-sacrifice. Death.<br>
			Ghaul: Death? Explain.<br>
			The Speaker: Devotion inspires bravery. Bravery inspires sacrifice. Sacrifice... leads to death. [sarcastic] So... feel free to kill yourself.<br>
			Ghaul: Devotion... sacrifice... I was born an outcast, a runt. As is custom with the Cabal, I was cast aside and left for dead. I was taken by an old scholar, himself disgraced, who saw in me something... redeemable. He raised me, taught me, trained me, and in return, I would become a vehicle for his revenge against an empire that failed him, and failed itself. Rejection, ridicule, torment... it made me stronger. I gave everything to win not just acceptance... but glory. Beneath my mask, Speaker, is the face of devotion and sacrifice. I will not take the Light by force; to do so would be to admit failure. And I never fail! Now, do you see why I would be chosen?<br>
			The Speaker: I see now. I see all you have done. [at that moment, the Consul enters, flanked by two Blood Guards]<br>
			The Consul: Our operation on the Jovian moon was a success. Once the cage is complete, we will have everything we need to begin the process of extracting the Light. Dominus, everything we've worked for is here for the taking! All that remains is your word.<br>
			Ghaul: No. This is not the way, old friend.<br>
			The Consul: But it is the way! The only way!<br>
			Ghaul: Not for me</p>
